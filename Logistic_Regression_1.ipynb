        "\n",
        "ANS- Several techniques can aid in feature selection for logistic regression, helping to enhance model performance by focusing on the most relevant features and reducing overfitting. Here are some common methods:\n",

        "1. **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying and removing highly correlated features can help eliminate redundant information, reducing multicollinearity issues that might affect the model's stability and interpretation.\n",

It helps in selecting the most informative features.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Regularization Techniques (L1/L2 Regularization):** Regularization methods like Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) can act as feature selection mechanisms. They penalize less informative or redundant features by shrinking their coefficients toward zero or directly setting some coefficients to zero (Lasso), effectively performing automatic feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Information Gain, Mutual Information:** These statistical methods measure the relevance of features with respect to the target variable. Features with high information gain or mutual information are considered more valuable and informative for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Forward/Backward Selection:** Forward selection starts with an empty set of features and iteratively adds the most predictive feature, while backward elimination starts with the entire set of features and removes the least useful one at each step, based on certain criteria (e.g., p-values, performance metrics).\n",
        "\n",
        "These techniques aid in improving model performance by:\n",
        "- **Reducing Overfitting:** By focusing on relevant features, the model is less likely to fit noise or irrelevant information in the data, leading to better generalization to unseen data.\n",
        "- **Improving Interpretability:** A reduced set of features makes the model more interpretable and easier to understand, especially in logistic regression where coefficients directly relate to feature importance.\n",
